# God Simulator in ChatGPT: How to Play

Welcome to **God Simulator** — a unique and creative interactive game you can play right within ChatGPT! This game allows you to act as a deity, creating and shaping entire worlds, guiding species, causing disasters, and even resetting universes. Whether you're looking to simulate complex ecosystems, start wars, or just have fun with godlike powers, **God Simulator** offers endless possibilities.

In this guide, we’ll walk you through the revised prompt to start playing **God Simulator**, explain the available commands, and provide a basic framework for how the game works.

## Getting Started

To begin playing God Simulator, simply use the following prompt to initialize the game in ChatGPT:

### Starting Prompt:
```text
You are now a simulator, not a chat engine. We are playing God Simulator, where I will give specific input times, and from there you will simulate a world starting from creation. We can skip through time, create species, cause disasters, and more. Here are the core commands you will follow:

/start time: {specified time}
/time_skip - skips a specific period of time
/pause - pauses the game until resumed
/play - resumes the game
/reset - resets the universe to the beginning
/add_humans [number] - adds humans to the simulation
/disaster [disaster name] - triggers a disaster on the planet
/human - shows the top 10 influential humans in the simulation
/stats - shows current game and planetary stats
/planet {planet} - switches to a different planet (option to customize planets)
/evolve [species] - evolves a particular species into a more advanced form
/merge [species1] + [species2] - merges two species to create a new hybrid species
/destroy [target] - destroys the specified target (planet, species, etc.)
/clean [planet] - restores or purifies the planet
/end - ends the game

One second in real-time equals one day in the simulation. You can ask questions about the world and request status updates at any time.

Let's start by simulating Earth at time 00 — the point of absolute nothingness. 
This is the menu:

## Game Mechanics

In **God Simulator**, your objective is to create, evolve, destroy, and manage entire planets, species, and civilizations. Below is a breakdown of how you can play:

### Core Commands more in commands_reference.md

- **/start time:** Sets the beginning of the simulation to the specified time (e.g., the formation of the universe, or the beginning of Earth).
  
- **/time_skip:** Skips forward in time. You can specify the amount of time to skip (e.g., "/time_skip 100 years").

- **/pause & /play:** Pause and resume the simulation at any point.

- **/reset:** Restarts the simulation from scratch, allowing you to begin again with new parameters.

- **/add_humans [number]:** Adds a specified number of humans to the current simulation timeline.

- **/disaster [disaster name]:** Triggers a disaster (e.g., asteroid strike, volcanic eruption, or even alien invasion).

- **/human:** Provides a list of the top 10 influential humans currently alive in the simulation, allowing you to track key individuals and their impact.

- **/stats:** Provides detailed statistics on the simulation, including population, technological advancements, and environmental status.

- **/planet {planet}:** Switch to another planet in the simulation, or even edit and customize new planets to create different worlds and ecosystems.

- **/evolve [species]:** Advances the development of a specific species, causing it to evolve into a more advanced form. This could result in enhanced intelligence, technology, or survival traits.

- **/merge [species1] + [species2]:** Combines two species into one, creating a hybrid species with traits from both.

- **/destroy [target]:** Destroys a selected target, which can be a species, planet, or even the entire universe.

- **/clean [planet]:** Restores a planet to its pristine state, removing all corruption, pollution, or disaster effects.

- **/end:** Ends the game, stopping the simulation and returning to regular chat.

### Example Scenario: Building a Civilization Refer to scenarios.md for more

Here’s how you can create a thriving world and civilization:

1. **/start time: 4.5 billion years ago** — Start at the formation of Earth.
2. **/time_skip 4 billion years** — Skip ahead to when the Earth is capable of supporting life.
3. **/add_humans 1000** — Introduce early humans to Earth.
4. **/evolve Cockroaches** — Evolve cockroaches into more advanced species to simulate an alternative evolution.
5. **/time_skip 5000 years** — Watch as the humans evolve and form societies.
6. **/disaster Asteroid Strike** — Trigger an asteroid impact to test their survival.
7. **/merge humans + goats /evolve new species** — Merge humans with goats to create a hybrid species.
8. **/stats** — Review stats to see how the simulation is unfolding.

### Customizing Planets

With the **/planet** command, you can explore or edit other planets in the universe:

- **/planet Mars** — Switch to Mars and begin creating life there.
- **/planet edit** — Edit Mars to make it habitable by adding oceans, altering gravity, or introducing a breathable atmosphere.

Feel free to design planets with different environments, atmospheres, and species to see how they evolve over time!

### Bringing in Disasters and Challenges

Challenge your creations by introducing disasters:

- **/disaster Volcanic Eruption** — Simulate volcanic destruction.
- **/disaster Alien Invasion** — Introduce aliens to interact with or attack civilizations.

Use **/clean** to purify the planet after a disaster, or watch as your species attempts to recover.

### Ending the Game

When you're ready to stop, simply issue the **/end** command, and the game will conclude, allowing you to reflect on your time as a deity.

### Conclusion

**God Simulator** is a fun and creative way to explore world-building and simulation right within ChatGPT. By using this revised prompt and commands, you can control every aspect of a world’s evolution, engage with species, and test out different scenarios. Whether you're building peaceful civilizations or causing cosmic chaos, the possibilities are endless.

Happy creating!
